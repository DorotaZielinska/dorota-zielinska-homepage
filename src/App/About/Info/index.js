      I was looking for something creative to do and I have found it in
      programming.
      <br /> So on that way I have start to develop my passion and knowledge
      about Frontend with React.
      <br /> I'a highly motivated Frontend Developer currently looking for new
      job opportunities to increase my experience, explore new technologies to
      improve my skills and become a better programmer.
